  This HTML and CSS program demonstrates the use of CSS transitions and the `transition-timing-function` property to control the timing and pace of the transition effects. Let's break down the key components:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Six `<div>` elements are created, each containing a different class: `.default`, `.ease`, `.linear`, `.ease-in`, `.ease-out`, and `.ease-in-out`.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - All `<div>` elements have a width and height of 100px, a blue background, white text, a font size of 24px, and a margin of 5px.
   - The `transition` property is applied to all `<div>` elements with a duration of 2 seconds. This property specifies which CSS properties should transition over time and the duration of the transition.
   - When any `<div>` element is hovered over (`div:hover`), its `transform` property is changed to `translateX(100px)`, causing it to move 100px horizontally to the right.

3. **Transition Timing Functions**:
   - Five additional classes (`.ease`, `.linear`, `.ease-in`, `.ease-out`, and `.ease-in-out`) are created, each specifying a different `transition-timing-function`.
     - `.ease`: Default timing function. The transition starts slowly, accelerates through the middle, and slows down again at the end.
     - `.linear`: Constant speed throughout the transition. The element moves at the same speed from start to finish.
     - `.ease-in`: The transition starts slowly and accelerates as it progresses.
     - `.ease-out`: The transition starts at full speed and slows down as it progresses.
     - `.ease-in-out`: Similar to `.ease`, but with a slower start and end.

4. **Behavior**:
   - When any `<div>` element is hovered over, it moves horizontally to the right by 100px over a duration of 2 seconds.
   - The timing function specified by each div's class determines how the transition progresses over time. Different timing functions produce different acceleration and deceleration effects during the transition.

In summary, this program demonstrates how to use CSS transitions and timing functions to control the pace and behavior of transition effects applied to elements. Each `<div>` element exhibits a different timing function when hovered over, resulting in varying visual effects during the transition.
