<!--  
	-all the images are placed in its normal flow of the document
    -we declared position: absolute
  -->
<!-- 

  - all the images are stacked on top of one another.
  - because they are positioned absolutely without specifying their individual positions. (top, bottom, left, right)
  - they will all positioned default to the top left corner of the nearest positioned ancestor, or the initial containing block if there is none.
  - there is no parent container with a specified position
  - if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
  - Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
