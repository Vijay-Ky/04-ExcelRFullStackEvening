<!-- 

    - Pseudo-elements ::before and ::after in CSS allow you to insert content into a document dynamically. 
    - ::before and ::after content not element
    - content: "" is required
    - img doesnt work
    - They are used to add decorative elements, such as icons, or to style specific parts of an element without having to modify the HTML structure.
