jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation for web development. jQuery is designed to make it easier to work with JavaScript on the client side of a website.

Key features of jQuery include:

DOM Manipulation: jQuery allows developers to easily manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), making it simpler to update, add, or remove elements on a webpage.

Event Handling: jQuery simplifies the process of handling events such as clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements, making it easier to create interactive web pages.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): jQuery provides a set of functions to make it easier to perform asynchronous HTTP requests (Ajax). This allows developers to update parts of a webpage without requiring a full page reload.

Animations: jQuery includes functions for creating animations, which can be useful for creating dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: jQuery abstracts away many of the differences between web browsers, making it easier for developers to write code that works consistently across different browsers.
