Basic Pillars of Object Oriented Programming Language
1. Inheritence
2. Abstraction
3. Encapsulation
4. Polymorphism

Inheritence
-----------
 - Aquiring the properties and behaviours of another class.
 - A class can inherit properties(variables) and behaviours(methods) from another class.
 - BASE class == PARENT class == SUPER class
   DERIVED class == CHILD class == SUB class
 - We can achieve inheritence using `extends` keyword in case of classes.
 - In case of extends the indication would be a solid line towards pointing to super type. 
 - We can inherite non-static variables
 - We can inherite non-static methods
 - We can inherite static variables

Can we inherit main method also?
----------------------------------
Yes. main method also inherits to the sub-class but:
1. If the sub-class is having its own main method, then if we call the main method from the sub-class it will be always calling the sub-class main method only.
2. If the sub-class doesnt have its own main method, then if we call the main method from the sub-class it will be always calling the super-class main method only.




 - There are 5 types of Inheritence
   -----------------------------------
   1. Single Inheritence
   2. Multi-level Inheritence
   3. Multiple Inheritence
   4. Hierarchical Inheritence
   5. Hybrid Inheritence

- The main use of Inheritence is code re-usability.
